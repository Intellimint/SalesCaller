### 🔥 Next Move: **Close the Loop**

Now that you can **see which leads are hot**, you need a reliable, replicable **next action** to convert them.

Here’s the unlock:

---

## 🎯 The "Next Action" for Hot/Warm Leads

> **Every warm/hot lead should be nudged toward a live demo, pilot link, or scheduled call.**

Make it automatic.

### 🌱 Option 1: **Send Personalized Follow-Up Emails**

* Use call transcript data to auto-fill:

  * First name
  * Company
  * Objection if any (“You mentioned you're already using…”)
  * Booking link (Calendly or Luma pilot)
* Use your voice: “Thanks again for the call—here’s that info I promised.”

**→ Replit Task:**

> Build `/api/email-leads` to send templated follow-up emails to all HOT or WARM leads using Mailgun or Gmail API.

---

### 🧠 Option 2: **Create “Lead Cards” for Manual Follow-Up**

* Clickable card view for each tagged lead
* Shows:

  * Summary
  * Tags: Hot | “Objection: Timing” | Positive Sentiment
  * Transcript snippet
  * Quick buttons: ✅ Email | 📞 Callback | 🗑️ Discard

**→ Replit Task:**

> Build a `/leads` frontend page that loads all tagged leads with sorting/filtering by interest level and objection type.

---

### 🧪 Option 3: **Let the Agent Try Again**

* If the objection was “Not now” or “Send info,” requeue it for retry with a different script.
* Use your tagging system to detect retry-worthy calls.

**→ Replit Task:**

> Add a “Retry Queue” button on the analytics dashboard: Requeues any warm/positive leads with retry-worthy objections for a follow-up call 3 days later using variation B of the script.

---

## 🧠 Strategic Goal for Conversion:

> **“Get every hot lead into an email inbox or calendar.”**

That’s your reliable, replicable close.
