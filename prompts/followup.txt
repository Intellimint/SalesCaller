Hi {contact}, this is Sarah calling back from SalesDialer. 

I tried reaching you earlier about the AI calling solution that could help {company} streamline your outbound sales process.

I know you're probably busy, so I'll keep this brief. We're seeing companies like {company} reduce their manual calling time by 75% while actually improving their connect rates.

I have just 5 minutes available today - would that work for a quick overview of how this could impact {company}?

If now isn't good, when would be a better time to connect?
