Here’s a full instruction block you can paste into Replit Agent to implement **authentication with per-user data and demo mode**:

---

### 🧠 REPLIT AGENT INSTRUCTION BLOCK — AUTH SYSTEM + DEMO USER

**Please implement the following authentication system for the SalesCaller app:**

---

#### 🔐 USER AUTHENTICATION (EMAIL + PASSWORD)

1. Create a new `users` table in the database with the following fields:

   * `id` (primary key)
   * `email` (unique)
   * `password_hash` (bcrypt hash)
   * `created_at`

2. Create API routes for:

   * `POST /api/signup` → Accepts email + password, creates user
   * `POST /api/login` → Accepts email + password, returns JWT
   * `POST /api/logout` → Clears session
   * `GET /api/me` → Returns current user details (if logged in)

3. Use **JWT-based authentication** (token stored in localStorage) with a secure `auth_middleware.py` to protect all API routes.

---

#### 🔁 PER-USER DATA ISOLATION

1. Add a `user_id` column to:

   * `leads`
   * `calls`
   * `campaigns`
   * `email_logs`

2. On data fetch/upload:

   * Automatically associate data with `user_id` of the logged-in user.
   * Restrict API access so each user only sees their own data.

---

#### 🧪 DEMO MODE (SAMPLE USER)

1. Create a hardcoded **demo user** (e.g. `demo@outboundfox.com`, password: `demo123`)
2. When users land on the site without an account, allow them to click **“Try a Demo”** which logs in the demo user.
3. For this user only:

   * Preload the **SF Restaurant Sample CSV**
   * Show the leads, campaigns, and analytics
   * **Disable actual call/email triggers** (disable buttons)
   * Show "sample data" tag or greyed-out style

---

#### 🔒 FRONTEND CHANGES

1. Add **login/signup modal** or page at `/login`
2. Update the navigation bar:

   * If logged in → Show Dashboard, Leads, Logout
   * If not logged in → Show Login, Try Demo
3. Add `useAuth()` hook or equivalent context to manage auth state

---

#### ✅ FINAL TASKS

* Redirect unauthorized users to login
* Ensure demo user data can't be modified permanently (optional reset on app restart)
* Add test user to test environment: `demo@outboundfox.com` / `demo123`
* Display sample leads as **read-only + greyed-out UI elements**
