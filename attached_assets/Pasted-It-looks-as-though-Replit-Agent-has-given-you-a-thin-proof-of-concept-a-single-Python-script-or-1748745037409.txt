It looks as though Replit Agent has given you a **thin proof-of-concept**: a single Python script or notebook that can hit the Bland API and place a call.  That’s a great sanity check, but it’s still miles away from a “mini-SaaS” you can hand to Shoman or beta customers.

Below is a punch-list of the **critical gaps** that still have to be filled before this becomes a usable, always-on lead-gen service.  I’ve grouped the items from *highest impact* to *nice-to-have* so you can decide how much more you want Replit Agent to automate.

| Area                     | What’s missing                                                                           | Why it matters                                                                                  | Action for Replit Agent                                                                                                       |            |            |           |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- |
| **Scheduler / Queue**    | Only a one-off `requests.post` call exists. No way to spool dozens or hundreds of leads. | Without a queue you can’t parallel-dial or resume after a crash.                                | Create `call_scheduler.py` with `asyncio.Queue`, concurrency flag, and a background task started from `main.py`.              |            |            |           |
| **Webhook endpoint**     | No `/webhook` route to receive Bland call events.                                        | You won’t capture outcomes, transcripts, or detect voicemail.                                   | Add a FastAPI `POST /webhook` handler that updates the DB and marks leads “done / voicemail / interested”.                    |            |            |           |
| **Database**             | No persistence—everything is in memory or a notebook cell.                               | Replit restarts will wipe state; you also can’t build a dashboard without historical data.      | Ship `db/schema.sql`, wire `aiosqlite` or `SQLModel`, and create helper functions `insert_lead`, `update_call`, `list_calls`. |            |            |           |
| **CSV / UI upload**      | No way to feed a batch of leads without editing code.                                    | Non-technical users need drag-and-drop or at least an `/upload` form.                           | Serve `/static/index.html`; hook a `POST /api/upload-leads` endpoint that parses CSV and inserts rows.                        |            |            |           |
| **Prompt templating**    | The sample sends a *single hard-coded* prompt.                                           | You’ll want different scripts per campaign, plus variable injection (company, person, product). | Drop files in `/prompts/*.txt` and add `render_prompt(lead_row, template_name)` using Python `str.format` or Jinja.           |            |            |           |
| **Secrets management**   | API key is hard-coded in the sample.                                                     | That’s insecure and will break when you push to GitHub.                                         | Use Replit Secrets (`os.getenv("BLAND_API_KEY")`), show placeholder `.env.example`, and strip keys from code.                 |            |            |           |
| **Dashboard**            | No live view of queued / completed calls.                                                | Without it you’re blind to failures and success metrics.                                        | Serve `/static/dashboard.html`, poll `/api/calls` every 10 s, render a table with phone, status, outcome, link to transcript. |            |            |           |
| **Error / retry logic**  | A failed call (`HTTP 403`, `429`, network blip) just raises an exception.                | At scale you’ll lose leads and won’t know why.                                                  | Wrap outbound call in `try/except`, implement exponential back-off, flag “errored” leads for retry.                           |            |            |           |
| **Voicemail detection**  | Bland Webhook returns status, but script hasn’t mapped it.                               | Need to count voicemails separately and maybe trigger a follow-up SMS/email.                    | In `webhook_handler.py`, translate Bland statuses → \`voicemail                                                               | interested | no\_answer | hangup\`. |
| **Concurrency limits**   | Bland’s default burst quota is 10 calls/sec; Replit CPU is limited.                      | Over-dialing will get you rate-limited or stalled.                                              | Add a global semaphore (`asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrency)`), configurable from env.                                         |            |            |           |
| **Logging & monitoring** | No structured logs or health-probe.                                                      | Debugging on Replit without logs is painful.                                                    | Use Python `logging`, emit JSON lines, and add a `/healthz` route that returns DB connection + queue depth.                   |            |            |           |
| **Unit / smoke tests**   | None.                                                                                    | Regenerating code with Replit Agent can break pieces silently.                                  | Ship `tests/test_prompt.py`, `tests/test_queue.py`; run with `pytest` in the Replit run-tab.                                  |            |            |           |
| **Security / auth**      | Dashboard is open to the world.                                                          | Anyone could upload numbers or read transcripts.                                                | Simple bearer-token or basic-auth on admin endpoints; token stored in Replit Secret `ADMIN_TOKEN`.                            |            |            |           |
| **Deploy script**        | Replit will start `main.py`, but no `replit.nix` or `.replit` yet.                       | Needed for automatic dependency install and port binding.                                       | Create `replit.nix` with python-311 + `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `httpx`, `aiosqlite`; set `.replit` run command.                  |            |            |           |

### Minimal “next sprint” for Replit Agent

1. **Refactor into `/main.py`, `/calls/`, `/static/`, `/db/`**
2. Add **SQLite schema + helper functions**
3. Implement **FastAPI** routes: `/api/upload-leads`, `/api/start`, `/api/calls`, `/webhook`
4. Build a **scheduler coroutine** that dequeues leads and fires `create_call()` with concurrency limit
5. Serve **index.html + dashboard.html** from `/static`
6. Migrate keys to **Replit Secrets**
7. Push a basic **`.replit` & `replit.nix`** so “Run” spins up Uvicorn

After that you’ll have a true one-click Replit SaaS: upload a CSV, press **Start**, watch calls flow, and read the results—all in the browser.

Let me know if you’d like a specific code snippet or a tighter task list to feed back into Replit Agent.
