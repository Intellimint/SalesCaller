Here‚Äôs a clear, step-by-step instruction set you can pass directly to the Replit agent to implement **non-callable sample data** as part of the app experience:

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Replit Agent Instructions: Implement Sample Lead Dataset (Non-callable)

Please complete the following tasks to safely integrate a sample dataset that new users can see but not call or email:

---

### **1. Database Schema Update**

* Modify the `leads` table to add a new column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE leads ADD COLUMN is_sample BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

---

### **2. Sample Data Loader**

* On app startup (or first login), check if the `leads` table is empty.
* If empty, load `SF Restaurant Sample - Sheet1.csv` into the database with:

```python
is_sample = True
```

* This data should **not trigger any calls or emails**.

---

### **3. Frontend UI Changes (Leads Page)**

* For all leads where `is_sample = true`:

  * Grey out the row visually (e.g. with Tailwind `opacity-50` or similar).
  * Add a `badge` or `label` that says ‚ÄúSample‚Äù next to the name or company.
  * Disable all action buttons (Call, Email, etc.) for these leads.
  * Add a tooltip: `"This is demo data to show how the system works. Upload your own leads to activate calling."`

---

### **4. Campaign Safeguards**

* Update campaign creation logic to **exclude** any lead with `is_sample = true`.

Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM leads WHERE is_sample = FALSE AND campaign_id = ?
```

---

### **5. "Remove Sample Data" Feature**

* On the Leads page, add a button:

  * Label: `Remove Sample Data`
  * On click, call backend endpoint:

```http
DELETE /api/leads?sample_only=true
```

* In the backend, implement:

```python
@app.delete("/api/leads")
def delete_sample_leads(sample_only: bool = False):
    if sample_only:
        db.execute("DELETE FROM leads WHERE is_sample = TRUE")
```

---

### ‚úÖ Summary:

This ensures new users always see how the app works, while avoiding any real-world issues from calling demo contacts.

Let me know once it's wired up and I‚Äôll help you polish the experience further.
